2.1.2
The maximum number of exchanges involving any particular item during selection sort is N - 1.
This happens when the first item has the highest value in the unsorted array and the other values are sorted.
For example, in the array 4 1 2 3, the element 4 will be swapped N - 1 times.
The average number of exchanges involving an item is exactly 2, because there are exactly N exchanges and N items (and each exchange involves two items).
